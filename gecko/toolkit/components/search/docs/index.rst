* Application-provided engine (aka app-provided): This is an engine that is
  provided by the application to the user as part of the configurations for the
  user's locale/region.
* Default engine: This is the engine that is the one used by default when
  doing searches from the address bar, search bar and other places. This may be
  a default application provided engine or a user selected engine.
* Default private engine: Same as for the default engine, but this is used by
  default when in private browsing mode.

  in the absence of user settings. In the code, this is referred to as
